Hangman game:
    Figure out how to have a "Press Enter to Start" screen.

Pick a random word from an array.

Set up a placeholder array using underscores instead of character.

Player makes a guess:
    If guess has already been made, break and throw an error
    Add letter to guessed letters.
    Search word array for a match.
        If there is a match, replace underscores in appropriate positions with letter
        If there isn't a match, player loses a life.

Repeat until the placeholder array has no underscores or the player runs out of lives
    Display win/loss screen
    Update win/less record
    Reset number of lives
    Goto 4
